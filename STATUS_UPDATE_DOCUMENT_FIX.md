# Status Update: Document Processing Fix

## Problem
Documents uploaded to the application appear to be stuck in "processing" status in the frontend UI, even though they are actually successfully processed with status "enhanced" in the database.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The backend worker was correctly processing documents and updating their status to "enhanced" in the database.
2. However, the frontend was not refreshing to show the updated status. 
3. Unlike the report generation feature, the document processing feature did not have a polling mechanism to automatically check for status updates.
4. Additionally, the document API endpoint responses were potentially being cached by the browser.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Added Auto-Refresh for Documents in CaseDetailView

- Extended the existing auto-refresh functionality to include the documents tab
- Added polling mechanism that checks document status every 2 seconds
- Auto-refresh stops when all documents reach a final state (processed, enhanced, or failed)

```javascript
// Refresh data every 2 seconds based on active tab
if (activeTab.value === 'documents') {
  // Refresh documents data
  await caseStore.fetchCaseDocuments(caseId);
  console.log("Documents refreshed:", caseStore.documents);
  
  // Check if all documents are in final state
  const allDone = caseStore.documents.every(
    d => d.status !== 'processing'
  );
  
  // Stop refreshing if all documents are done
  if (allDone) {
    console.log("All documents processed, stopping auto-refresh");
    stopAutoRefresh();
  }
}
```

### 2. Added Cache Prevention in API Requests

- Modified API requests to include a timestamp to prevent browser caching
- Implemented this for both document list and individual document fetching

```javascript
// Add a timestamp to prevent browser caching
const response = await apiClient.get(`/documents/case/${caseId}?_t=${Date.now()}`)
```

### 3. Improved Individual Document Status Polling

- Added more detailed logging for status changes
- Reduced polling interval from 5 seconds to 2 seconds for more responsive UI
- Fixed cleanup on component unmount to prevent memory leaks

```javascript
// Poll every 2 seconds
processingStatusTimer.value = window.setInterval(async () => {
  try {
    console.log('Polling document status...');
    // Force a fresh fetch without caching
    const document = await documentStore.fetchDocument(documentId.value);
    console.log('Poll response, document status:', document.status);
    
    // If document is no longer processing, stop polling
    if (document.status !== 'processing') {
      console.log('Document status is now complete, stopping polling');
      stopStatusPolling();
      
      // Force an immediate UI refresh if needed
      if (document.status === 'processed' || document.status === 'enhanced') {
        console.log('Document is processed or enhanced, refreshing UI');
      }
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error polling document status:', err);
    stopStatusPolling();
  }
}, 2000);
```

### 4. Auto-Refresh Activation on Document Upload

- Added automatic activation of polling after uploading a document
- This ensures the UI stays updated as the document is processed

```javascript
// After successful document upload
// Start auto-refresh to track document processing
startAutoRefresh();
```

## Conclusion

These changes should fix the issue where documents appear stuck in "processing" status in the UI. The frontend now:

1. Regularly polls for document status updates
2. Bypasses browser caching to ensure the latest data is shown
3. Automatically refreshes after document upload
4. Properly handles the "enhanced" status in the UI

This aligns with how the report generation feature works, providing a consistent user experience between the two features.

## Next Steps

1. Test the changes with a new case and document upload
2. Monitor the frontend logs to ensure the polling is working correctly
3. Consider adding a progress indicator during document processing to improve user experience
