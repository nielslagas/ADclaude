2. **Large Document Processing**: Documents >100 pages may experience timeouts
   - **Workaround**: Split large documents into smaller parts
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement streaming processing for large documents

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Usage**: Current implementation may use significant memory for large documents
- **Concurrent Processing**: Currently limited to sequential section generation
- **Caching**: Limited caching strategy for repeated operations
