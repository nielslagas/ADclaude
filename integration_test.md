# AD-Rapport Generator Integration Test

This document outlines the results of integration testing for the AD-Rapport Generator application. The application has been tested to verify that all components work together correctly.

## API Testing Results

| Endpoint                    | Status | Notes                                     |
|-----------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| Root endpoint               | ✓      | Returns correct API information           |
| Authentication              | ✓      | JWT token validation works correctly      |
| Cases listing               | ✓      | Returns list of cases for the user        |
| Case creation               | ✓      | Successfully creates new cases            |
| Case detail                 | ✓      | Retrieves specific case information       |
| Document upload             | ✓      | Handles file upload and storage correctly |
| Document processing         | ✓      | Parses documents and creates chunks       |
| Report templates            | ✓      | Retrieves available report templates      |
| Report generation           | ✓      | Creates and processes reports correctly   |

## End-to-End Flow Testing

1. **User Authentication**
   - Login/logout functionality works correctly
   - Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login

2. **Case Management**
   - Creating, viewing, and deleting cases works as expected
   - Cases are properly associated with authenticated users

3. **Document Handling**
   - Document upload correctly handles .docx and .txt files
   - Documents are properly stored in the database
   - Document processing (chunking and embedding) works correctly

4. **RAG Pipeline**
   - Embeddings are generated for document chunks
   - Vector similarity search works correctly
   - Section-specific prompts generate appropriate content

5. **Report Generation**
   - Reports are created with the correct template
   - Sections are generated based on document content
   - Reports can be viewed and sections can be regenerated

## Frontend Testing

| Component                   | Status | Notes                                     |
|-----------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| Navigation                  | ✓      | Links work correctly and active state shown |
| Case listing                | ✓      | Shows all cases for the logged-in user    |
| Case detail                 | ✓      | Shows case information and related items  |
| Document upload             | ✓      | Uploads files and shows progress          |
| Document detail             | ✓      | Shows document information and status     |
| Report creation             | ✓      | Allows selecting templates and creating reports |
| Report viewing              | ✓      | Shows generated sections with options to copy/regenerate |

## Performance Testing

- Document processing completes within acceptable time frames
- Vector similarity search performs efficiently
- Report generation completes within expected timeframes

## Security Testing

- Authentication correctly protects endpoints
- Users can only access their own data
- Token validation properly enforced
- File upload validates file types and sizes

## Conclusion

The integration testing confirms that the AD-Rapport Generator is functioning correctly as an MVP. All core components (authentication, case management, document processing, and report generation) work together smoothly. The RAG pipeline successfully generates content based on document analysis, and the frontend provides a usable interface for working with the application.

## Next Steps

Based on this testing, the next phase should focus on:

1. Enhancing the RAG pipeline with more advanced techniques
2. Improving the frontend UI/UX based on user feedback
3. Adding more template options and customization
4. Implementing more robust error handling and recovery
5. Adding user management features for collaborative work
